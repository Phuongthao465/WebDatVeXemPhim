    <h1>Most U.S. eagles suffer from lead poisoning, study suggests</h1>
    <h2>The bald eagle - bird of prey found in north america</h2>
    <p class="intro">The majority of adult bald and golden <a class="eagles" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_eagle">eagles</a>  carry high levels of lead, which derives from hunters’ ammunition, a large study found.</p>
    <h3>No safe exposure</h3>
    <p>In the study, the scientists collected samples from living and dead eagles. In the former, researchers measured levels of lead in the blood of birds they captured, or in the course of receiving veterinary care unrelated to the study, while they tested the dead animals’ bones, livers, and feathers.</p>
